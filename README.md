# Kinsta - Hello World - Node.js
An example of how to set your Node.js application up to enable deployment on Kinsta App Hosting services.

> Kinstaâ€™s Application Hosting is a service to run your web apps and any databases side by side in a hassle-free environment, tailored for developer needs and ease of use. App Hosting is currently in an invite-only beta phase, sign up for a test account at [kinsta.com/application-hosting](https://kinsta.com/application-hosting/).

## Dependency Management
During the deployment process Kinsta will automatically install dependencies defined in your `package.json` file.

## Web Server Setup

### Port
Kinsta automatically sets the `PORT` environment variable. You should **not** define it yourself and you should **not** hard-code it into the application. Use `process.env.PORT` in your code when referring to the server port. 

```
app.listen(process.env.PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Hello World Application is running on port ${process.env.PORT}`)
})
```

### Start Command
When deploying an application Kinsta will automatically create a web process with `npm start` as the entry point. Make sure to use this command to run your server. If you would like to use another command you will need modify the runtime process in MyKinsta.

```
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
  },
```

## Deployment Lifecycle
Whenever a deployment is initiated (through creating an application or re-deploying due to an incoming commit) the `npm build` command is run, followed by the `npm start` command.
